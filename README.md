# WIA1002 Data Structure Group Assignment 2023/2024 
## Bomberman GUI with Tic-Tac-Toe Challenge
This project is developed for the Data Structure course. In this project, we have implemented algorithms such as bread-first search and depth-first search to find the shortest path, as well as all possible paths in the maze. Stack and queue data structures have been used extensively during the development.

### Usage
Users have to select a path to advance in the map, with stations that have console-based tic-tac-toe challenge. Users must win against computer engine to proceed next step. Losing the challenge would result in the user being jumped back to the previous position before saved.

### Tools and Language
Utilized IntelliJ, Java (JDK 17), Java Swing, Excel as database
